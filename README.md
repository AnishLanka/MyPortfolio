# MyPortfolio

My portfolio showcases all my skills and projects through a sleek and intuitive interface. In order to build this webpage I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, JSX, and a JSON database. All of these components combined helped make a responsive design with dynamic functionality. Users can explore my work seamlesly or browse around the website with no issues thanks to the smooth transitions and interactive elemnents. Whether it's viewing my latest projects, learning about my background, or contacting me, this website is the place to be.

In order to run the webpage you will need to open the terminal and type "npm run start" after that you will need to open a new terminal and then type "npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000" Doing these steps will ensure that my portfolio is running and functioning on your end.
